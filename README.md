# 💳Credit Risk Analysis
HEYY🤸, this is Zijun, and welcome to my Git page.😘😘

## 🔎Project Overview
In the modern financial world, loaning involves the risk that some people will pay back while others default. This project aims to use Python and machine learning to build a model that predicts whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan from a bank's perspective.

## 🥸Getting Started
- To start cooking, ensure you have Python installed (VS Code used).
- Run the .ipynb file in the **notebooks** folder.
- Some of the visualization results are in the **results** folder.

## 🐈Steps to go
- **Exploration**: get a brief understanding of the dataset etc;
- **Data Cleaning**: deal with missing values and anomalies etc;
- **Analysis**: exploration analysis, correlation matrix, feature importance, SMOTE, modeling, model evaluation etc.

## 📋Dataset Fields
- **SeriousDlqin2yrs**: 90 days or more of overdue behavior (i.e., defining good and bad loans)
- **RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines**: The ratio of available loan and credit card lines to total lines
- **age**: Borrower's age
- **NumberOfTime30-59DaysPastDueNotWorse**: The number of overdue 35-59 days in the past two years but no worse
- **DebtRatio**: Monthly debt repayment, alimony, living expenses divided by monthly total income
- **MonthlyIncome**: Monthly income
- **Number rOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans**: Number of open loans and lines of credit
- **NumberOfTimes90DaysLate**: Number of times a borrower is 90 days or more past due
- **NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines**: Number of mortgage and real estate loans, including home equity lines of credit
- **NumberOfTime60-89DaysPastDueNotWorse**: Number of times a loan is 60-89 days past due but has not progressed to a worse state in the past two years
- **NumberOfDependents**: Number of dependents in the household excluding oneself (spouse, children, etc.)

## 🌌Further Moves
- Perform more explorations on more interesting variables, or use a pairplot to to gain more insights;
- Use different predictive models and compare them (XGBoost).
